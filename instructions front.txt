Frontend




Based on the instructions in @instructions front.txt and considering the use of the Web Speech API, here's a step-by-step approach to building the frontend:
1.Project Setup:
	• Set up the React project using Vite (already done)
	• Install additional dependencies (React Router, Axios, etc.)
2.Create Basic Component Structure:
	• Implement a layout component (Header, Main content area, Footer)
	• Create placeholder components for Home, Login, Registration, Dashboard, and Transcription views
• 3.Implement Routing:
	• Set up React Router for navigation between components
• 4.State Management Setup:
	• Implement React Context API for global state management
	• Create reducers for user authentication and transcriptions
• 5.API Integration:
	• Set up Axios for API calls
	• Create service functions for user authentication and transcription CRUD operations
• 6.User Authentication:
	• Implement Login and Registration forms
	• Connect authentication forms to the backend API
	• Set up protected routes for authenticated users
7. Web Speech API Integration:
	• Create a SpeechRecognition component
	• Implement start/stop functionality for speech recognition
	• Handle real-time transcription display
	• Implement language selection for multi-language support
8. Transcription Management:
	• Create a transcription list view
	• Implement a transcription detail view with editing capabilities
	• Connect transcription management to the backend API
• 9.Dashboard Implementation:
	• Create a user dashboard displaying recent transcriptions and user info
• 10.Styling and Responsive Design:
	• Apply Tailwind CSS for styling
	• Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
11. Error Handling and User Feedback:
	• Implement error boundaries
	• Add loading states and error messages
• 12.Accessibility and Internationalization:
	• Add ARIA attributes for accessibility
	• Set up react-intl or a similar library for internationalization
• 13.Performance Optimization:
• Implement code splitting and lazy loading for larger components
	• Optimize asset loading
• 14.Testing:
	• Write unit tests for key components and functions
	• Implement integration tests for main user flows
• 15.Final Polish:
	• Add any remaining features (dark mode, offline support, etc.)
	• Perform cross-browser testing
Create user documentation or help section
